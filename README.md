This was my third app â€“ a simple and user-friendly calculator built to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's designed with a clean UI for ease of use and helps strengthen my understanding of fundamental app logic, UI handling, and event-driven programming.

Key Features:
Intuitive button-based interface
Real-time display updates
Handles basic math operations
Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero)
